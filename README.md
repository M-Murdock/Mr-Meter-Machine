## Adding/Updating a book
`retrieveLines.js` generates the Iliad.html file from the corresponding json file. It can be run with `node retrieveLines.js`. It looks for the json file bookX.json where X is the book number with the Iliad lines, correct scansion, and any notes. Within the `retrieveLines.js` file, `book` should be set to the matching book number.
